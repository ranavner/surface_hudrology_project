# Surface Hydrology Course Final Project

Welcome to the repository for my final project in the Surface Hydrology course. This repository contains the code and the final report for the project.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze changes in weather patterns using monthly, daily, and hourly data from various sources. The project is divided into two main sections:

1. **Extreme Events Return Period Analysis:** This mandatory section involves the analysis of return periods for extreme weather events, and Penman evapotranspiration for 5 selected years.
2. **Specific Research Question:** This section investigates the short-term impacts of the 2010 volcanic eruption in Iceland on the weather in Reykjavik.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/surface-hydrology-project.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd surface-hydrology-project
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file with the necessary data:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook project_notebook.ipynb
